{"prompt":"wanted to ask if there are any existing applications built with Semaphore's stack that I can take a look at?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yes, this boilerplate can help: \nhttps://github.com/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate\nEND"}
{"prompt":"trying hard to understand the technical effort PSE team has put in here with my limited IQ, wanted to know if the membership proofs are reusable? that means like a messaging group chat app, can the proof be used again and again to send multiple messages?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Semaphore proofs have a mechanism to prevent the same proof from being successfully verified twice (by using nullifiers), because proofs are generated privately but anyone could see and re-use/verify them again. However, in an anonymous chat app, users can re-generate their proofs with a different nullifier to send multiple anonymous messages in the same chat/group/topic.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"how long does it take usually for a desktop to re-generate a proof?\n\n###\n\n","completion":"You can use this small web app to generate a proof and see how long it takes: https://benchmarks.semaphore.appliedzkp.org/.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"I am not getting, proving knowledge of the private information without revealing the private information. This is more of a fundamental question on ZK Merkle tree membership I guess. I can't find anything that explicitly states how this is proved in ZK...\n\n###\n\n","completion":"You are actually proving that you have knowledge of the preimage of one of the leaves in the tree, and you just privately provide the Merkle path to that leaf.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"How does the merkle path not reveal information about the leaf?\n\n###\n\n","completion":"It does, but keep in mind that the path is also private.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"valid membership proofs require a list of all sibling nodes and the identity commitment itself. I cannot see how a valid proof keeps the path private, there is a trick here somewhere that I am missing...\n\n###\n\n","completion":"The proof is that the prover knows a Merkle path where the root is the same as the public root. The path is a "private input" and only the root is a "public input", and the proof is zero knowledge. In this case, the verifier never knows the leaf from the provided proof; he/she only knows that: 1. The prover knows some leaf, 2. The prover knows some valid path from leaf to root, 3. The prover generated a proof according to the latest version of the Merkle tree.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"is it possible to delete identities?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" a simple explanation is that you must store history of roots in contract because of synchronisation issues, so if you want to delete someone you'll have to delete it from the whole history.\nEND"}
{"prompt":"What is the oficial Semaphore website?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Semaphore website is: https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/\nEND"}
{"prompt":"Example of a Semaphore project\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This is an example of a Semaphore project: https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate\nEND"}
{"prompt":"Why does an identity require both the identity trapdoor and the identity nullifier?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It's like an additional security layer. If someone breaks the nullifier hash (imagine there is some malleability that Poseidon preimage is easy to find when hashed with specific value X, which is the external nullifier chosen by devs), the attacker can find all messages the same person sent, but they cannot find which person, because there is also the trapdoor, which could be more difficult to break.\nEND"}
