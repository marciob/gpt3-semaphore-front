The private inputs required for the circuit to run are treeSiblings[nLevels], treePathIndices[nLevels], identityNullifier, and identityTrapdoor. treeSiblings[nLevels] are the values along the Merkle path to the user's identity commitment, while treePathIndices[nLevels] are the direction (0/1) per tree level corresponding to the Merkle path to the user's identity commitment. identityNullifier is the 32-byte identity secret used as nullifier, while identityTrapdoor is the 32-byte identity secret used as trapdoor.
